**Project 1:**

This program delivers an inventory summary report. This program will read data about various products in a store's inventory from a file into a number of ArrayLists. This program will display a summary report of the information from the inventory file.

**Project 2:** 

This program delivers an inventory summary report. This program will read data about various products in a store's inventory from a file into a single Product object and maintain an ArrayList of Product objects. This program will display the report in the format of a table. This program will also calculate the highest average user rating in stock, the lowest average user rating in stock, the largest total dollar amount in inventory, and the smallest total dollar amount in inventory.

**Project 3:**

A practice with advanced ideas such as inheritance and the use of interfaces. These are data structures that provide a collection of songs and an ordering for how those songs will be played.

**Project 4:**

This program takes orders for products and ship them to customers based on what they have in inventory. This program reads an order from a text file, turns that order into a list of products, determines which products can be shipped now and which must be delayed until later, and then produce two reports – one showing what will be shipped now, and one showing what portions of the order remain “on hold” for a later date.

**Project 5:**

The program performs the following actions:
Ask the user to enter the name of the file that contains the paths.  Verify that the user has actually entered a value and not an empty line.
Load that file into an adjacency list.
Display the adjacency list to the console in a nicely formatted report.
Prompt the user for the name of a start city.
Find the shortest paths from that start city to all destinations and display that as a nicely formatted report.
Continue asking for start cities until the user enters a blank line.

**Project 6:**

This program will perform simple algebraic operations (+, -, \*, /, %), and will be able to handle expressions of any length properly by putting the expression into a binary expression tree and then evaluating the expression tree. These methods make use of the ExpressionTree<E> class.
