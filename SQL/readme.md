For a semester-long project, I created an information management system and database with SQLite Manager for a bookstore to support its inventory and sales operations.

1. Listing the entities and the relationships between entities to be modeled in the database
2. Drawing ER diagram and relational schema
3. Normalizing database so that it is at least in third normal form
4. Writing SQL scripts needed to create database schema on an empty database.
5. Writing SQL scripts to load data into the database
6. Performing SQL queries
7. Manipulating database using INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE statements
