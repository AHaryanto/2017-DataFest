### Diet-Specific Grocery Item Recommendation

A recommendation engine that will identify the similarity between different products based on the key features of the food items to potentially expose shoppers to new products that meet their dietary needs, and inform grocery chains of customer shopping behavior and patterns

Key Methods:
1. Run an Apriori algorithm to determine which items might be purchased together
2. MatchÂ consumers based on their purchasing behavior using SVD
3. Group products together based on nutrition amount, and volume using KNN
