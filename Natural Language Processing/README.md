Document Similarities of National Constitutions

Looking at a countryâ€™s constitution is a good way to get a high level picture of the government system. Thus, we decided to compare the constitutions of 192 countries to see how similar they were to one another. 

We collected html copies of each constitution from the Constitute Project: www.constituteproject.org
