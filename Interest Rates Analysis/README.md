### Interest Rates Analysis

In this project I analyzed daily records of the U.S. Treasury Yield to Maturity (YTM) from 1981 to 2014. The dataset contains seven yields and markers for periods when FED implemented easing policy (reducing rates) or tightening policy (increasing rates). Below is a sample of the dataset.
