### Predicting Loan Interest Rates

Data:
Each row represents a loan and its features such as interest rate assigned to the loan, date loan was issued, and loan grade. There is a total 32 features in the data. 

Models:
I built two machine learning boosting models -  XGBOOST and gradient boosting - to predict the interest rate a bank will assign various loans. 
XGBOOST produced lower RMSE compared to gradient boosting and therefore was a better model.
